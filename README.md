# CBOR

A library for encoding and decoding CBOR. The library is structured in a way that optimizes encoding and decoding streams rather than rendering objects in memory.

**If you have suggestions for API improvements please let me know. I do not have a strong opinion on how this library should be operated.**

See the [package documentation](doc/cbor.txt) and the [bignum module](src/cbor/bignum.nim) for more information.
